# SpudWorld: SQL and Relational Database Design Project

## Introduction

Welcome to **SpudWorld**, a hands-on educational project developed by:
* Abdulqadir Abuharrus
* Cameron Postnikoff
* Gurjeet Bhangoo
* Oceaan Pendharkar. 

This project is designed as a learning exercise in SQL and Relational Database Design, using the fascinating world of potatoes—from farming to consumption—as our subject.

## Project Overview

In SpudWorld, we explore the lifecycle of potatoes, capturing the entire journey in a relational database. This project encompasses various aspects of the potato industry, including cultivation, processing, distribution, and retail.

## Core Entities

Our database includes a range of entities, each representing a crucial part of the potato ecosystem:

- **Potatoes**: Classified by type, price, and market potential, and linked to farms, storage facilities, and processing companies.

- **Farmers and Farms**: The starting point of our potato journey, where different varieties of potatoes are cultivated.

- **Equipment Suppliers and Manufacturers**: Entities responsible for providing the necessary equipment for farming and processing potatoes.

- **Processing Companies and Storage Facilities**: These handle the potatoes post-harvest, preparing them for distribution.

- **Distributors, Importers, and Exporters**: The logistical backbone, managing the movement of potatoes to various markets.

- **Retailers and Consumers**: The endpoint of the supply chain, where potatoes are sold and consumed.

- **Researchers and Market Analysts**: Providing data and insights into potato varieties, cultivation methods, and market trends.

- **Trade Shows and Advertisers**: Events for showcasing advancements and for educational purposes.

## Learning Objectives

Through SpudWorld, we aim to:

- Develop a comprehensive understanding of relational database design and SQL.
- Apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world inspired scenario.
- Enhance our skills in data modeling and database management.

## For Educational Purposes

This project is part of our coursework and is intended solely for educational purposes. It provides a scenario for us to apply database design principles in a structured, engaging context.

## Collaboration and Feedback

While this is a classroom project, we welcome constructive feedback and suggestions from our peers and instructors to improve our database design and SQL skills.
